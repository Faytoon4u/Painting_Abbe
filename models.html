                <br>By Marlene Dumans (1994)
                <br>
                <br>The work 'Models' by the South African artist Marlene Dumas 
                consists of a hundred drawings of women's heads that hang in four
                rows above each other on the wall. They are made with washed ink.
                Here and there the eyes are colored with pastel chalk. In some drawings,
                you can recognize portraits of women by artists from the past,
                such as Rembrandt, Vermeer. Others are based on photographs 
                of famous people including Paloma Picasso and
                Brigitte Bardot. still others to images of fashion models. There is one 
                exception among women's heads, the head of a snake.
                <br> I realy like the painting from Briggite Bardot it realy poped out for me.
