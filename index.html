                <br>By Pablo Picasso (1943)
                <br>
                <br>Picasso was one of the most famous Spanish painters.
                He is known for co- founding the Cubist movement. 
                Picasso made many works with women as its theme. 
                Throughout his life he had several relationships with women,
                which he often used as painting models. 
                Whenever he fell in love again, 
                it was evident in his work by a change of styles.
                My opinion about Picasso 
                I appreciate his work because it looks so magical 
                and at first glance. When you look at it for longer you notice
                a lot more and realize it is an abstract painting.
