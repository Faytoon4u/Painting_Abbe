                <br>By Sanja Ivekovic (1943)
                <br>
                <br>Her work in photomontage, video, and performance 
                explores the role of women in society, using her 
                own life and history as source material. 
                Iveković’s series GEN XX comprises six black-and-white photographs of women, 
                all but one appropriated from advertisements, and replaces the text, slogans,
                and product references with the names of anti-fascist, female resistance fighters
                from Nazi-occupied Yugoslavia. GEN XX suggests that these revolutionary figures
                should be held up as heroines and as recognizable to us as the most popular models in the world.
